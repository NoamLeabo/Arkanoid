# 🧱 Arkanoid Game - Java Edition

Welcome to **Arkanoid Game**, a fun and classic brick-breaking game implemented in Java. This project showcases the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles while delivering an interactive and challenging game experience with multiple levels and power-ups.

## 🎮 Game Features

- **3 Challenging Levels**: Navigate through progressively harder levels with blocks that require varying strategies.
- **Grey Blocks**: These blocks need to be hit multiple times to change color. Only when they become color blocks can they be popped.
- **Candy Power-ups**: Some blocks drop candies when popped, with different effects:
  - **Blue Candy**: Increases the size of the paddle.
  - **Pink Candy**: Adds an extra ball.
  - **Green Candy**: Decreases the size of the paddle.
- **Multiple Balls**: Keep track of your active balls through the heart indicators at the top of the screen. More balls mean more fun, but also more challenges!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java:** Core programming language
- **Swing & AWT:** For graphical user interface rendering
- **OOP Concepts:** Classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism are at the heart of the game’s structure.
